4. **requests**  
   - A Python library for making HTTP requests (used to fetch data from APIs).  
   - Install with:  
     ```bash
     pip install requests
     ```

5. **subprocess**  
   - A Python module for running shell commands (used to execute `kubectl` commands).

6. **concurrent.futures**  
   - A Python module for concurrent execution (used for parallel processing of nodes and namespaces).

#### **Optional Dependencies**
1. **Gunicorn**  
   - A production-ready WSGI server for deploying the Flask app.  
   - Install with:  
     ```bash
     pip install gunicorn
     ```
